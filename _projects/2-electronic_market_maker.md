title: "Robot Trader"
excerpt: "Implemented an automated market maker using a range of technical trading indicators in combination with Cliff’s ZIP algorithm. The goal was to maximise profit (or net-worth) over a trading period in a simulation of a limit-order-book financial exchange. I then presented the results from various performance tests of the market maker, including with altering market price trends and altering trader agent populations, to best gauge its quality."
