title: "Naumachia (multiplayer, virtual reality, naval battle survival game)"
excerpt: "Lead a team of six in building an immersive and competetive online virtual 
reality experience for a third year university group project. We wrote over 2200
lines of C# code using an agile development method. We also implemented extensive 
use of version control, continuous integration and sprint planning through GitLab.
Features included a robust and scalable enemy AI system, responsive voice control 
commands, immersive custom hardware controls, 3D models, textures and animations 
designed/created by us, multiplayer support both over LAN and the internet and an 
original music soundtrack.<br/><img src='/images/naumachia.png'>"
